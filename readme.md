# Natural Language Processing 

### About

This repository contains several NLP projects in Python. It addresses
some of the most common problems in the domain, such as:

- Autocorrect
- Sentiment Analysis
- Part of Speech Tagging
- Named Entity Recognition
- Text Generation
- Machine Translation
- GPTs

For each problem, I will start with naive solutions and gradually proceed
to more complex ones, by interacting with tools such as:

- Word encodings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Minimum edit distance (Levenshtein distance)
- Viterbi algorithm
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- LSTMs 
- Transformers

These solutions do not intend to build production-ready applications,
but rather help me get familiar with the NLP sector in theory and 
in practice.

The data (corpora) used to train and evaluate the models will not be uploaded
to avoid copyright issues. However, there will be instructions in each
subdirectory in order to configure your own datasets.
